# Project 1 Report


## Summary

## Introduction

The goals of this project are to implement a simple version of a data link layer protocol according to the specification provided in the guide. Also, a simple transmitter and receiver data transfer application should be developed to test the implemented protocol. 

The report is divided into eight sections: 

* Introduction: an overview of the report's logic and a summary of the information that is provided in each of the following sections, in tandem with an explanation of the goals of the work and the report.

* Architecture: description of the functional blocks and interfaces.

* Main Use Cases: identification of the main use cases of the application and the function calls sequence.

* Link Layer Protocol and Application Layer Protocol: pinpointing of the main features of the protocol and description of their implementation strategy with code snippets and how it is structured.

* Validation: catalog of the tests performed showing quantitative results.

* Link Layer Protocol Efficiency: statistical characterization of the efficiency of the protocol.

* Conclusions: recap of the information from the previous sections and list of the main learning goals achieved.

## Architecture

The architecture of the application is a layered architecture. The core concept of layered architectures is the idea of layer independence. Each layer is independent of the other layers, and each layer only depends on the layer immediately below it.

### Functional Blocks


## Main Use Cases

The main use cases of the application are the following: 

## Link Layer Protocol

## Application Layer Protocol

## Validation

## Link Layer Protocol Efficiency

## Conclusions

## Annex I. Source Code
